Procedural/ Functional programming languages:

1) variables are used to store values in them

2) conditional statement:

    IF-else:
    if a condition is true then the code within the if block will executed other wise code in the else block will be executed
    
    ELSE IF LADDER:
    else if ladder is used when we have more than two possibilites or two choices.
   
3) Loops: loops are used when we need to execute same piece of code again and again


    For loop: for loops are used when you exactly know how many iterations or repitions must be done of same code
    ex: If you exactly know 5 members will be coming to party and you need to shake hands with them
    
    syntax: for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                code
            }
    
    While loop: while loops are used when we need to execute a code till a condition becomes true
    ex: If you need to shake hands with your friends but you don't know how many of them are then use you while loop
    
    syntax: while(friends != 0)
            {
               code
            }
            
            
4) Functions: 

    Functions are used to split up the problem into pieces
    
    Functions help us to divide the code into individual parts
    
    Then they are executed individually
    
    Functions can also be used to execute a piece of code again and again without needing to write it again and again
    
    Functions are of 4 types:
    
      1) functions with return value: These are used when you want to get the output of a function to the main function
      2) functions with parameter: These are used when you want to insert something from main function to the function
      3) functions with return and parameter: These are used when you want to do both the inserting and receiving data to and from the function
      4) functions without return and without paramter: These are used when you don't want to insert or receive any data from a function
